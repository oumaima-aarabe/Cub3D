# Cub3D

## Introduction
Welcome to Cub3D, a project inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D! This project is a raycasting game engine implemented in C, using the MiniLibX library for graphics. The goal is to create a simplified version of the game engine capable of rendering 3D environments from a 2D map.

## Description
Cub3D is a project that explores the fundamentals of raycasting and graphics rendering. It reads a map file representing a 2D maze and renders a 3D perspective of the environment in real-time. The project also includes features like texture mapping, sprite rendering, and basic collision detection.

## Features
- **Raycasting Engine**: Cub3D implements a basic raycasting engine to render 3D environments from a 2D map.
- **Texture Mapping**: Textures are applied to walls and sprites to enhance the visual experience.
- **Map Parsing**: The project reads a simple map file to generate the game environment dynamically.

## Getting Started
To run Cub3D on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- MiniLibX Graphics Library

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/cub3d.git
2.compile the source code using make or make bonus to get all features

3.To run the Cub3D game, execute the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash    
    
    ./cub3d path_to_map_file.cub
## Controls
- `W`: Move forward
- `A`: Strafe left
- `S`: Move backward
- `D`: Strafe right
- `Q`: Rotate left
- `E`: Rotate right
- `ESC`: Exit the game
  you can use the mouse too to move in bonus
